To fix this error, simply add an alias to the subquery.  This alias then needs to be used to access the columns in the outer query.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM (SELECT id FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales') AS sales_employees;
```

Here, the subquery is aliased as `sales_employees`.  The outer query can now reference this alias.  This corrected query correctly counts the number of employees in the Sales department.
